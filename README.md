## 📈 Key Insights
1. Identified **5 unique customer segments** with distinct characteristics.
2. **Cluster 2** – High-income, high-spending, highly engaged customers (most profitable group).  
3. **Cluster 1 & 3** – Low-spending, low-engagement segments; need reactivation strategies.  
4. **Cluster 0** – High-income but low campaign acceptance; opportunity for targeted marketing.  
5. **Cluster 4** – Mid-income consistent buyers; opportunity for loyalty programs.
